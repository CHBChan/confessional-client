# confessional-client

This is the frontend of the confessional project I came up with on a whim. Over all, the project was fairly simple but I learned a lot, particularly the backend.


You can test the project here: https://chbchan.github.io/confessional-client/

**The response to retrieve confessions from the backend can be slow since I'm too poor to pay for one**

## Frameworks/Libraries used for the frontend:
[React.js](https://react.dev/)

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

[uuidv4](https://github.com/thenativeweb/uuidv4#readme)
