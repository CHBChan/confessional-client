# confessional-client

This is the frontend of the confessional project I came up with on a whim. Over all, the project was fairly simple but I learned a lot, particularly the [backend](https://github.com/CHBChan/confessional-server).

### Description

You can send confessions from the frontend to a dedicated server to be stored. You can also look at random confessions from other users retrieved from the backend.

Live demo: https://chbchan.github.io/confessional-client/

***The response to retrieve confessions from the backend can be slow since I'm too poor to pay for a server***
